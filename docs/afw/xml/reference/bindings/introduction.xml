        In Adaptive Framework, functions are naturally exposed to the outside 
        world as C library functions, which can be dynamically linked to an 
        application or a library by linking them at compile time.

        However, in some cases, it is desirable to expose a function to the 
        outside world in another language that may be more convenient to write 
        in. We make this possible by providing a HTTP-based interface to 
        invoking function calls and using an appropriate language library to 
        implement this call. This allows us to call Adaptive Functions in 
        languages such as Javascript, Python, PHP or Perl.

    <paragraph>
        At this time, the language bindings do not link directly to the shared 
        libraries that contain the functions. Instead, they may use the 
        HTTP-based interface, or the local command-line interface to invoke the 
        functions. This allows us to use the same interface for all languages.
