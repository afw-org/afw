        You may find yourself using Adaptive Framework Core in order to 
        build something of your own. There's nothing that prevents you from 
        setting up your own project to use Adaptive Framework, but you may 
        find that the <literal>afwdev</literal> provides some convenient 
        helper commands to get you started and to maintain your project. A 
        project that uses <literal>afwdev</literal> to build and maintain 
        is called a <literal>Package</literal>.

        extensions, configurations, objects or layouts using Adaptive 
        Framework and maintained using the <literal>afwdev</literal> 
        tool. The following illustrates the file system layout of a typical 
        package:
