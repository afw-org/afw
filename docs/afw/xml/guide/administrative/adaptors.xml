    <section>
        <title>Adaptive Framework Core</title>
        <paragraph>
            This adaptor is a special adaptor, because it always exists and 
            there is only one instance of its type. This adaptor is provided 
            by the Adaptive Framework Core and uses the adaptorId of "afw".  
            It presents objects that have been compiled into memory and also 
            generates runtime objects that exist from configurations and 
            environment. Objects from the Core adaptor are read-only.

        <paragraph>
            This adaptor allows adaptive objects to be stored in the native

        <paragraph>
            This is a special adaptor that's used to support mapping objects 
            based on model adaptive object types to one or more objects from 
            another adaptor.
