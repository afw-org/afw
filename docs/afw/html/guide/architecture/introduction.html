        <code>Adaptive Framework (AFW)</code> is a framework for building 
        applications that facilitate the access of data from common sources,
        such as databases, and presents the data and its metadata in flexible
        formats that can be consumed and interacted with by clients or
        applications that work well with object data. You will find that many
        aspects of its design resemble common technologies, such as
        <code>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)</code>, <code>Enterprise 
        Integration Patterns (EIP)</code> and <code>Enterprise Service 
        Buses (ESB)</code>. This framework implements many of those same 
        ideas and patterns in a way that's very extensible, adaptable to
        technology changes, considerate of open standards, and available as open
        source.
    
</p><p class="text-lg text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-400">
    
        While many of the development-time tools were written in Python and much
        of the user interface components were written in TypeScript and
        Javascript, the core of Adaptive Framework is written in C, a language
        in which the primary engineers have had decades of experience with. This
        implementation decision affords us fine-grain control over some of the
        more technical aspects covered by this framework, while benefiting from
        the notable efficiency characteristic of C. However, it is intended that
        users of the framework will likely never have to write a line of C code.         
        Instead, using the built-in extensions, configuration files, language
        bindings, expressions and scripts, you can influence the adaptive
        framework runtime without having to build or recompile anything. 
    
</p><p class="text-lg text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-400">
    
        It's important to understand that this is a framework, not a product or
        solution, and everything provided by Adaptive Framework are tools to
        help build applications that would benefit from these features. 
        Specific application requirements will vary and some applications may 
        wish to use more or less features from this framework than others.
    
</p><p class="text-lg text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-400">
    
        Adaptive Framework was also designed to be modular. A core set of
        features exist, but extensions can be added at runtime and register
        additional features that look just like first-class citizens.

            Adaptive Framework was partially inspired by ideas and concepts
            from <code>Adaptive Object Model</code> (<a href="http://adaptiveobjectmodel.com">http://adaptiveobjectmodel.com</a>).  
            Nearly everything in Adaptive Framework is described by objects and
            metadata. By separating data from metadata, and representing them
            by separate objects, we achieve flexibility over design that is very
            dynamic and doesn't require recompilation when metadata is changed.

            The origins of Adaptive Framework grew from a set of procedures and
            tools that were created for the purpose of maintaining an identity
            vault. We needed to integrate data from several systems and conform
            to the unique rules that each system presented. We also needed to
            conform to the unique needs of our user base. Data access, data
            transformations, provisioning and deprovisioning, web applications,
            security, and data inconsistencies were just some of the many
            challenges to our project. During this process, it was also became
            obvious that the only constant we could seem to rely on was change
            itself. Requirements, data, protocols and software were always
            changing. Staff, along with their expertise, moved between groups or
            retired. Vendors could go out of business and licensing costs could
            change. It was imperative, therefore, to design something that was
            adaptable to all of these moving parts.
        
</p><p class="text-lg text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-400">
    
            One feature that we really wanted was to be able to plug in any
            database of choice and allow for all applications, new or legacy, to
            interoperate with with each other. We also wanted to harvest
            metadata from existing systems and use it to make business decisions
            without replicating code and policy. We wanted to be able to adapt
            to new software technologies and data formats without changing
            business rules that were in place. We needed the ability to generate
            documentation and APIs in order to keep up with the data model that
            was constantly changing. Finally, it was ideal for the solution to
            be open source. These emerging design features - the interface
            definitions, objects, metadata, data types, functions, expressions,
            languages, language bindings, command-line and web-based tools, doc
            and code generation - produced the Adaptive Framework.

                In order to configure an application, we use 
                <code>Configuration Objects</code>, along with a single 
                <code>afw.conf</code> file to instruct the application 
                instance which extensions to load, what services to start and 
                where to locate additional configurations.

                The <code>Data</code> in this diagram may be optional, 
                structured databases, object stores, log files, event journals,
                or anything else that may be used by services to read or persist
                data.

                The <code>Application</code> is the sum of
                everything in this diagram, and is defined to Adaptive Framework
                through a special configuration object. This documents the
                application and provides some additional processing
                instructions, such as which extensions to load at startup, a
                default authorization script, general file path information and
                some properties useful for the Administrative Web Application.
