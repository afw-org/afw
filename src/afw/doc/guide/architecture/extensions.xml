        The Adaptive Framework Core contains a lot of useful interfaces,
        functions and data types out of the box, by default. However, the
        built-in core cannot include everything and cannot anticipate what
        technologies are developed or gain popularity. Therefore, it's useful to
        extend the Core to include additional features, via the use of
        <literal>Extensions</literal>.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        An Adaptive Framework Extension is a shared library, which, when loaded
        by the Core, may register interface implementations, such as additional
        data types, functions, adapters, content types or request handlers.
        These allow for other technologies to be integrated in a way that they
        can seem like a part of the core, as first-class citizens.
