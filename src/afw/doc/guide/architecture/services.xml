        Many of the interface implementations that were discussed in previous 
        sections require additional configuration in order to make them useful.
        For instance, the LDAP adapter needs to understand what service to 
        connect to and which bind credentials to use. A File Adapter needs to 
        know which directory it should store and retrieve files from, and in 
        what Content Type. An authorizationHandler may need to know which 
        policies to use or what script to execute.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        When Adapters, Logs or authorizationHandlers are configured in 
        Adaptive Framework, we bundle a configuration object into an object 
        instance of <literal>_AdaptiveServiceConf_</literal>. These is used 
        to create what's known as a <literal>Service</literal>. A service is 
        something that can be started, stopped or restarted by Adaptive 
        Framework. This allows an administrator to change configuration options 
        without having to restart the entire application.

        The following example demonstrates what a service configuration object
        looks like, using the LMDB adapter:
    </paragraph>
    <code>
{
    "serviceId": "adapter-lmdb",
    "startup": "immediate",
    "conf": {
        "type": "adapter",
        "adapterType": "lmdb",
        "adapterId": "lmdb",
        "description": "A LMDB database for person registry",
        "env": {
            "mapsize": 10485760,
            "maxdbs": 128,
            "maxreaders": 126,
            "mode": 384,
            "path": "/afw/lmdb"
        }
    }
}
    </code>
    <paragraph>
        This particular configuration will create a LMDB adapter immediately 
        upon startup.
