    <section>
        <title>Adaptive Framework Core</title>
        <paragraph>
            This adapter is a special adapter, because it always exists and 
            there is only one instance of its type. This adapter is provided 
            by the Adaptive Framework Core and uses the adapterId of "afw".  
            It presents objects that have been compiled into memory and also 
            generates runtime objects that exist from configurations and 
            environment. Objects from the Core adapter are read-only.

        <paragraph>
            This adapter allows adaptive objects to be stored in the native

            another adapter.
