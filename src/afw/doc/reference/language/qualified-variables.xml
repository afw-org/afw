    <paragraph>
        Adaptive Script allows you to declare local and const variables, using 
        the <literal>let</literal> and <literal>const</literal> keywords. 
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        Some variables are declared outside of the execution a script, 
        expression or template. These variables are read-only and are provided 
        by Adaptive Framework, often to share contextual information that may 
        be useful for developer when trying to rendering a decision. For 
        example, Adaptive Models often evaluate adaptive scripts in order to 
        transform objects and properties. In order to do so, the script, 
        may need to obtain access to the properties or values that they are in 
        the process of transforming. These special, read-only variables are 
        called <literal>Qualified Variables.</literal>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        Qualified Variables take the form <literal>qualifier::identifier</literal>. 
        The qualifier part of the variable is derived from the context in which 
        the variable is provided. For instance, <literal>current::mappedObjectTypeId</literal> 
        is a Qualified Variable that is provided by the Adaptive Models when 
        processing an object that is being mapped to another object.
