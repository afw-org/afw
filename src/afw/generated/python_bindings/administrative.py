    Load extension by id

    Load an extension by its extension id if it is not already loaded.
    Loading an AFW package's manifest extension will register the manifest of

        extension_id (string): This is the object id of a
        /afw/_AdaptiveManifest_/ object.

    Returns:
    boolean: If false the extension was already loaded. If true, the extension was successfully loaded which might have caused side effects such as environment registry changes. An error is thrown if there is a problem.
