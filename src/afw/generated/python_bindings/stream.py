        this open file stream.

        path (string): This is the path to the file to open. The
        rootDirectory of the path is defined in the application object.

        mode (string): This is the access mode string. Values can be:
        r - Open an existing file text file for read.
        w - Open a text file for writing. If the file does not exist, it
        will be created.
        a - Open a text file for writing additional data to the end. If the
        file does not exist, it will be created.
        r+ - Open a text file for both reading and writing.
        w+ - Open a text file for both reading and writing. If the file
        exists, it will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will
