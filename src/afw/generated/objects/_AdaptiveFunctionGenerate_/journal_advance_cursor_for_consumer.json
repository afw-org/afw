The limit parameter specifies the maximum number of entries to scan for an applicable entry for consumer before returning. NULL is always returned.\n\nThere are no response properties set by this function.\n\nThe properties of the _AdaptiveProvisioningPeer_ object associated with the consumer_id are used in the following way:\n\nThe consumerFilter expression is used to determine if an entry is applicable.\n\nJournal entries are scanned beginning at the entry at the cursor in the advanceCursor property. If the advanceCursor property is not present, the scan begins after the cursor in currentCursor. If neither are present, the scan begins at the start of the journal.\n\nIf an new applicable entry is found or if the limit is met, the advanceCursor property is set to the currently scanned entry's cursor.",
