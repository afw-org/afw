#
# Strings that will be included in <prefix>_s .h and .c.
#
# - Blank lines and lines that begin with # are ignored
# - The string name must start in the first colon
# - All spaces in each line is significant
# - If a line does not contain an equal sign (=), the string name and
#   associated value are the same.
# - For lines that contains an equal sign (=), the name is the characters
#   that precede the equal sign and the value is everything after the equal
#   sign up to the end of the line.  The value can contain valid c escape
#   characters such as \n.  By convention, name should start with a_ to
#   distinguish it from name where name and value are the same.
#
# The generate process will automatically produce strings for object type ids,
# object is, property names, and a few other things found in the
# generate/objects directory.  
#
# Duplicate string definitions are ignored.  Avoid assigning the same name
# with different values since all but one will be ignored.
#
# Example strings:
#   afw
#   a_hello_world=Hello World!
