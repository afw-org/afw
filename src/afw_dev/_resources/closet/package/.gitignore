#
# The first part of this .gitignore is specific to an afw package. The entries
# after the "The following are standard .gitignore entries for afw projects"
# comment, are probably appropriate for all afw packages.
#
# The .gitignore file of the base afw repository is used by the afwdev command,
# "afwdev make-afw-package", as a skeleton for new afw packages. After the new
# package is created, afwdev will not overwrite the .gitignore file, so it is
# safe to remove unnecessary entries or keep them as examples, as well as add
# new entries.
#

#
# Put patterns for directories here that should NOT be ignored even if a 
# if they are covered by another pattern.
#
# Note: If a parent directory is ignored, it is not possible to re-include
# the subdirectory.
#
#!src/afw/compile/

#
# If you build within the source tree, you will need to ignore the executables
# produced. This will happen if you use the autotools generated Makefile or
# if cmake is used without specifying a build directory. The "afwdev build"
# command uses a build directory when cmake is used.

# This is always produced during any afw package build with the current git
# info. It should always be ignored. It would be incorrect anyways since
# pushing it would change the git info.
