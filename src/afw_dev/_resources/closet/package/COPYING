In addition, Adaptive Framework and any software that has been developed using
Adaptive Framework, also known as an "Adaptive Framework Package", will use 
third-party libraries that are normally installed using the operating system's
package handling utility. These third-party libraries may include additional
licensing requirements. To identify these third-party libraries, refer to the
instructions used to build the Adaptive Framework Package.

Historical note:

When Adaptive Framework was started, it was being jointly developed with
Omnibond Systems, LLC., so the boilerplate copyright included them.  All
of the source in the current branches of the repository has been developed
by Clemson University staff. Boyd Wilson of Omnibond Systems, LLC. agreed
that their copyright can be removed from the current source code for ease
of open sourcing.
