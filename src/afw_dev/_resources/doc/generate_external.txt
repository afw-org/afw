generate/external/
------------------

Directory generate/external/ can contain any of the directories other
than external/ that can be contained in a generate/ directory.  During
./dev generate processing, if generate/external is present, the contents
of generate/external and all of the directories in generate/ except
external/ and temp_generate/ are merged in an appropriate way to
produce generate/temp_generate/, which is then used for the generate
process.

A src/<subdir> can use a script or other means to create
generate/external/ to provide additional objects, strings, etc.
