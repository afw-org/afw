generate/ebnf/
--------------

This the generate/ebnf/ directory exists, all *.txt files other than README.txt
will be processed.

Each *.txt file will add a file to generated/ebnf/.

Lines that begin with '#' are ignored.

The first line that is not ignored is used as the filename of the file added to
generated/ebnf/. Each of the following lines is a pattern used to search for files
in the associated source subdir.

Each matched source file is searched for ebnf to be added to generated/ebnf/
file as follows:

1) Lines that contain *ebnf>>> indicate the start of the ebnf up to a line that
   contains *<<<ebnf.  A comment is emitted with the source file name and line
   number.
2) Lines in the ebnf that contain '*#' are comments.  Everything after the '*#'
   will be emitted surrounded by '/*' and '*/\n'.
3) Everything is ignored on each line up to the first '*'.  If there are no '*'
   in a line, the whole line is used.
4) Lines that contain '::=' represent the beginning of a production and determine
   the indent for additional lines of the production.  Leading whitespace for the
   '::=' line is removed.  An empty line followed by this line and the following
   non-blank lines are emitted.
