generate/manifest/
-------------------

AdaptiveFramework environment registry has the following structure:

<AdaptiveFramework runtime environment registry>
|-- adaptor_type
|   |-- A registry <KEY>
|   ... More <KEY>s
|-- log_type
|   |-- A registry <KEY>
|   ... More <KEY>s
... More <REGISTRY_TYPE>s

See afw/afw_environment.h for more information.

The generate/manifest/ directory has a similar structure.  It contains zero or
more subdirectories with the name of a <REGISTRY_TYPE> that each contain zero
or more <KEY>.c files.  It also contains a manifest.json file that contains
the properties used when creating the _AdaptiveManifest_ object except for the
registers property.

The generate/manifest/<REGISTRY_TYPE>/<KEY> directory names are used by
generate to produce the "registers" property of the <SRCSUBDIR>'s
_AdaptiveManifest_ object and the <KEY>.c files the function to register the
<REGISTRY_TYPE>/<KEY>.

Each <KEY>.c files must have a function that will be called by
generated/<PREFIX>generate.c to register the <REGISTRY_TYPE>/<KEY>.

The definition for the function must be of this form:

void <PREFIX><REGISTRY_TYPE>_<KEY>_register(afw_xctx_t *xctx)

Development tool afwdev can be used to add these <KEY>.c files using
subcommands like add-adaptor-type and add-log-type or they can be added
manually.

For example, to register adaptor_type my_type with a factory struct define in
<SRCSUBDIR> my whose const struct is my_adaptor_factory, either manually put
this in <SRCSUBDIR>/generate/adaptor_type/my_type.c or let afwdev to do it.

#include "afw.h"

extern const afw_adaptor_factory_t
my_adaptor_factory;

void
my_adaptor_type_my_type_register(afw_xctx_t *xctx)
{
	afw_environment_register_adaptor_type(
		my_adaptor_factory.adaptor_type,
		&my_adaptor_factory,
		xctx);
}
