generate/objects/_AdaptivePolymorphicFunction_/
-----------------------------------------------

Currently only available in core afw/ directory.

This directory can contain an _AdaptivePolymorphicFunction_ objects
that produce the appropriate _AdaptiveFunctionGenerate_ objects.

These objects must have:

	"dataTypeMethod": true,
	"polymorphic": true,
	"polymorphicDataTypes": [ list of supported data types]

These objects can also have:

	"polymorphicExecuteFunction": is the useExecuteFunction for all the data types
	"polymorphicOverrides": is overrides for specific data types
	
See the object type object _AdaptivePolymorphicFunction_ for more information.

This directory is provided for convenience.  The same results can be
obtained by using another means to add the polymorphic function object
plus a function objects for the polymorphic data types to the
objects/_AdaptiveFunctionGenerate_/ directory.
