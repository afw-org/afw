Adaptive Framework
==================

## What is Adaptive Framework?

Adaptive Framework is a set of interfaces for developing servers, requests, object access, etc. in an adaptive way, along with implementations, language bindings, commands, tools, and administrative applications.

## This Repository

**NOTE**: This repository is very preliminary and incomplete.  Adaptive
Framework is still under initial development and is not intended to be
used in it's current form.  It will change significantly.  

Development is currently being done in the `develop` branch, but will be merged into `main` once it's in a state appropriate for public use.

## Roadmap

Prior to creating our first release, we intend to finish a few major features that are currently underway:

  * Memory Management
  * Adaptive Script Language Features
  * Comprehensive Unit, Integration and Stress Tests
  * Complete Documentation

Once the first release is created, we will maintain a Roadmap for future and keep this README updated with the current status of the project.

## Building and Running

The [documentation](https://afw-org.github.io/afw/) contains much more 
comprehensive steps towards building and running Adaptive Framework at this stage. However, a few quick steps are listed below:

 * [Building on Linux](/src/afw/doc/building_on_linux.md)
 * [Building on Windows](/src/afw/doc/building_on_windows.md) 
 * [Building on MacOS](/src/afw/doc/building_on_mac)

We also have public Docker images available:

  * [Development Image](https://ghcr.io/afw-org/afw-dev)
  * [Production Image](https://ghcr.io/afw-org/afw)
